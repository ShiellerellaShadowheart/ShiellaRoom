            <p>
              Tupac has done many horrid things but he always believed in doing the right thing. He inspired many homeless shelters by letting homeless people stay in his home. He also fought against discrimination. He gave all of us a lot to think about throughout his songs. He was raised by gangsters who all fought for the same goal. Equality. He continues to inspire people to this day.
